# hackthenorth-frontendapp
My Hack the North 2021 Frontend Developer Challenge

## Task
You've been tasked to build a tool to display events for both hackers and the general public. Attendees would have to log in to access the full list of events as hackers!

## Part 1 Project
An endpoint for event information is available at https://api.hackthenorth.com/v3/graphql. You can choose to either hit the endpoint using a GraphQL Client or HTTP methods.
